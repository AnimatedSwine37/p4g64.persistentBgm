A mod for Persona 4 Golden PC (64 bit) that lets BGM from dungeons continue into battles instead of switching to the battle music every time. This is configurable per dungeon and can be set to a percentage chance so the game can switch to the battle music only some of the time instead of always or never. 

Note that by default this mod will do nothing as every dungeon's BGM is set to have a 100% change to play the battle music (the vanilla game's behaviour). **You must change the default config if you want the mod to do anything!!!**

The configuration is a decimal value between 0 and 1 representing the chance that battle BGM will play. 1 means battle BGM always plays, 0 means battle BGM never plays, 0.5 means battle BGM plays 50% of the time, etc.
